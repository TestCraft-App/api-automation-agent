In the Subscription Service, before you can subscribe a user, you need to create a plan using POST /plans.
This endpoint sets up the available subscription options.
Once a valid plan exists, you can subscribe a user by calling POST /subscriptions,
which requires a planId referencing one of the plans you've created.
If you need to cancel a subscription later, you can use PATCH /subscriptions/{id}/cancel,
but this action is only possible if a subscription was previously created through POST /subscriptions.
