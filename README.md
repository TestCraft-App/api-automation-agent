# API Automation Agent

An open-source AI Agent that automatically generates an automation framework from your OpenAPI/Swagger specification, based on the api-framework-ts-mocha template (https://github.com/damianpereira86/api-framework-ts-mocha).

## Features

- Generates type-safe service and data models
- Generates test suites for every endpoint
- Reviewes and fixes code issues and ensures code quality and best practices
- Includes code formatting and linting
- Runs tests with detailed reporting and assertions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- OpenAI API key or Anthropic API key (Anthropic API key required by default)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-automation-agent.git
    cd api-automation-agent
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
    ```

## Large Language Models

This project supports both Anthropic and OpenAI language models:

### Default Model
**Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) is the default and recommended model
- Provides superior code generation and understanding
- Offers the best balance of performance and cost

### Supported Models
**Anthropic**
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)

**OpenAI**
  - GPT-4o (gpt-4o)
  - GPT-4o Mini (gpt-4o-mini)
  - GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-turbo)
  - GPT-3.5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo)
  - O1 Preview (o1-preview)
  - O1 Mini (o1-mini)

You can configure your preferred model in the `.env` file:
```env
MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  # Default value
```

## Usage

Run the agent using the following command:

```bash
python ./main.py path/to/your/openapi.yaml
```

### Options

- `--destination-folder`: Specify output directory (default: ./generated-framework_[timestamp])
- `--use-existing-framework`: Use an existing framework instead of creating a new one
- `--endpoint`: Generate framework for a specific endpoint only
- `--generate`: Specify what to generate (default: models_and_tests)
  - `models`: Generate only the data models
  - `models_and_first_test`: Generate data models and the first test for each endpoint
  - `models_and_tests`: Generate data models and complete test suites

### Examples

```bash
# Generate complete framework with all endpoints
python ./main.py api-spec.yaml --destination-folder ./my-api-framework
```

```bash
# Generate models and tests for a specific endpoint using an existing framework
python ./main.py api-spec.yaml --use-existing-framework --destination-folder ./my-api-framework --endpoint /user
```

```bash
# Generate only data and service models for all endpoints
python ./main.py api-spec.yaml --generate models
```

```bash
# Generate models and first test for each endpoint in a custom folder
python ./main.py api-spec.yaml --generate models_and_first_test --destination-folder ./quick-tests
```

```bash
# Combine options to generate specific endpoint with first test only
python ./main.py api-spec.yaml --endpoint /pet --generate models_and_first_test
```

The generated framework will follow the structure:
```
generated-framework_[timestamp]/    # Or the Destination Folder selected 
├── src/
│   ├── base/                       # Framework base classes
│   ├── models/                     # Generated TypeScript interfaces and API service classes
│   └── tests/                      # Generated test suites
├── package.json
├── (...)
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Testing the Agent

To try out the agent without using your own API specification, you can use the sample API definitions provided in the `api-definitions` folder. They are derived from the Pet Store API described in https://petstore.swagger.io/#/

1. Start with the Store endpoints (recommended for testing and debugging because of its size):
```bash
python ./main.py api-definitions/petstore-swagger-store.json
```

This is a simple and small API specification that includes basic CRUD operations and is ideal for testing the agent's capabilities.  

Estimated cost to run Store example: US$ ~0.1

Other available test specifications:
- `api-definitions/petstore-swagger-user.json` User endpoints
- `api-definitions/petstore-swagger-reduced.json` User and Store endpoints
- `api-definitions/petstore-swagger.json` Complete Pet Store API

Each specification varies in complexity and will generate different amounts of code and tests, affecting the total cost of execution.

### Finding Tasks to Work On

We maintain a [project board](https://github.com/users/damianpereira86/projects/1/views/1) to track features, enhancements, and bugs. Each task in the board includes:
- Task descriptions
- Priority
- Complexity
- Size

New contributors can check out our ["Good First Issues"](https://github.com/users/damianpereira86/projects/1/views/7) view for beginner-friendly tasks to get started with.

### Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and linting
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request to the original repo

### Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please open an issue on GitHub with:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

## Code Formatting

This project uses strict code formatting rules to maintain consistency:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used as the Python code formatter
  - Line length is set to 88 characters
  - Python 3.7+ compatibility is enforced
- VS Code is configured for automatic formatting on save
- Editor settings and recommended extensions are provided in the `.vscode` directory

All Python files will be automatically formatted when you save them in VS Code with the recommended extensions installed. To manually format code, you can run:
```bash
black .
```

## Logging

The project implements a dual logging strategy:

1. **Console Output**: User-friendly, simplified format showing only the message content
    ```
    Generated service class for Pet endpoints
    Creating test suite for /pet/findByStatus
    ```

2. **File Logging**: Detailed logging with timestamps and metadata in `logs/[framework-name].log`
    ```
    2024-03-21 14:30:22,531 - generator.services - INFO - Generated service class for Pet endpoints
    2024-03-21 14:30:23,128 - generator.tests - INFO - Creating test suite for /pet/findByStatus
    ```

The log level can be controlled through the debug flag, with DEBUG level providing more verbose output for troubleshooting.
